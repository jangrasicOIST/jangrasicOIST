1. Warm up medium, prepare the cabinet (warm medium, rack for cryotubes, 15 mL tubes for centrifugation)
2. Get an ice bucket only if you thaw many samples at once (not recommended).  
3. Bring the frozen tubes to the culture room as fast as possible and thaw them in the water bath for 1 min. (If you have more than 1 tube, use the floating tube holder. Donâ€™t submerge the lid of the tube to prevent contamination.)
4. Spray the tube to disinfect it and place it in the cryotube rack. Take 4.5 mL of medium and add 4 mL to the 15 mL tube and 0.5 mL to the cryotube. The volume of the cryopreservant in the tube is 0.5 mL so this adds up to 1 mL total. Drop the medium slowly in the cryotube to minimize osmotic stress. Transfer the 1 mL to the 15 mL tube and gently mix the solution.
5. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 3 min. 
6. Gently remove the tube from the centrifuge and aspirate the supernatant, not disrupting the pellet. 
7. Resuspend the cells in 3 mL of medium and take a sample for cell counting. Take two cell counting samples with the 1 mL pipette and manually count the cells in two chambers. Count the outer edges of the grid and omit cells touching the inner lines of the grid. Divide the number of counted cells by the number of squares and multiply by 10^4 to get number of cells/mL. Multiply by the volume of cell suspension to get total number of cells.   
8. Transfer the cells from the 15 mL tube to a 6 cm dish and gently mix the suspension in the dish. 
9. Write the name, date, PDL, cell number, and cell type on the lid.
